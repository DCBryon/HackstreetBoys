# Hackstreet Boys Overview
### API key is not located in the repo, as I believe that is bad practice. So we'll just send it out when needed :)
Core functionality still needed:
  - ~~Take the output of the logmeal API (json), and format it into usable text.~~
  - Get an ai API working on our web app. (openai, gemini, etc.)
  - Feed the ai all the ingredients and get it to generate recipes
  - Display the recipes to the user
Nice to haves:
  - Allow user to add & remove items in the list of detected foods
  - Prettty formatting
  - Display recipes not yet avalible with suggestions for what ingredients must be purchased

We got this team :D

### Also I changed our default directory, to "Backend-test", so watch out for that
